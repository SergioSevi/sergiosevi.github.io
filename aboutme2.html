									<h1>About me</h1>
								<p>I am a researcher studying the imprints of extensions of the standard model into the cosmological history of the universe. You can find my academic history and a brief description of my research interests here. You can find my full CV here </p>
							

									<h3 class="major">Academic history</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/tuDur.jpeg" alt="" /></span>My academic journey began with a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge, 
																			where I developed a strong foundation in complex physical theories. This experience inspired me to pursue a PhD in Theoretical Cosmology 
																			at the University of Nottingham, focusing on scalar-tensor theories of gravity and their mathematical and physical implications.
																					<br><br>
																			After earning my PhD, I joined Durham University as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Physics and the Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology. 
																			Here, I collaborate with leading experts in high-energy physics and cosmology, working on developing new theoretical models and computational tools. 
																			This role allows me to merge my passion for physics with a commitment to advancing scientific knowledge.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Research interests</h3>
									<p>During my PhD at the University of Nottingham, I focused on scalar-tensor theories of gravity, producing significant research on various cosmological phenomena.
										I authored three key papers: one on fifth forces, exploring their potential observational signatures and implications for fundamental physics; another on 
										the development of FeynMG, a Mathematica code extending FeynRules to handle gravitational interactions in scalar-tensor theories; and a third paper investigating
										early dark energy models (EDOs) as a possible resolution to the Hubble tension.

										At Durham University, as a postdoctoral researcher, I have continued to advance my research in high-energy physics and cosmology. My work here includes a notable paper that tests early dark energy 
										models on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), providing crucial insights into how these models could explain observed cosmological discrepancies. This research contributes to a deeper understanding 
										of the universe's expansion history and the fundamental forces at play.</p>
